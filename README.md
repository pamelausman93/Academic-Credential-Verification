# Academic Credential Verification Platform

## Overview
Decentralized platform for secure academic credential issuance, verification, and selective disclosure on the Stacks blockchain.

## Key Features
- Institutional registration
- Credential issuance
- Credential verification
- Revocation mechanism
- Selective disclosure of credential information

## Smart Contract Functions

### Institution Management
```clarity
(register-institution (institution principal))
```
- Owner-only institution registration
- Enables credential issuance rights

### Credential Lifecycle
```clarity
(issue-credential (recipient principal) (credential-hash (buff 32)))
(revoke-credential (credential-id uint))
```
- Secure credential creation
- Institutional control over revocation
- Unique credential identification

### Selective Disclosure
```clarity
(add-selective-disclosure 
  (credential-id uint) 
  (field (string-ascii 20)) 
  (value (string-utf8 500))
)
```
- Granular information sharing
- Recipient-controlled disclosure

### Verification
```clarity
(verify-credential 
  (credential-id uint) 
  (credential-hash (buff 32))
)
```
- Cryptographic credential validation
- Revocation status checking

## Technical Details

### Data Structures
- Credentials Map: Institution, recipient, hash, issuance date
- Institutions Map: Authorized credential issuers
- Selective Disclosure Map: Additional verifiable information

### Security Features
- Owner-only institution registration
- Institutional verification for issuance
- Recipient-controlled selective disclosure
- Immutable credential tracking
- Revocation mechanism

### Error Handling
- `u100`: Owner-only operation
- `u101`: Resource not found
- `u102`: Already issued
- `u103`: Unauthorized access
- `u104`: Credential revoked
